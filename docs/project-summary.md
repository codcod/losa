## 🛠️ Technical Achievements

### **Advanced AI Integration**
```python
# Example: AI-Powered Document Processing
from losa.chains.document_chain import CompleteDocumentProcessingChain

processor = CompleteDocumentProcessingChain()
result = await processor.process_complete_application(
    documents=uploaded_docs,
    document_contents=extracted_text,
    application_data=loan_app_data
)
# Returns: document analysis, income verification, credit analysis, explanations
```

### **LangGraph Workflow Orchestration**
```python
# Example: Intelligent Workflow Processing
from losa.workflows.loan_workflow import process_loan_application

# Processes through: validation → documents → credit → risk → decision
processed_app = await process_loan_application(loan_application)
print(f"Decision: {processed_app.decision.decision}")
print(f"Confidence: {processed_app.decision.confidence_score}")
```

### **Type-Safe Business Logic**
```python
# Example: Validated Loan Application
from losa.models.loan import LoanApplication

app = LoanApplication(
    personal_info=personal_data,      # Auto-validated
